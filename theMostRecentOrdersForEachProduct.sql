Write a solution to find the most recent order(s) of each product.

The result format is in the following example.

+-------------+-----------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |

| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 1          |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 1          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output: 
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| keyboard     | 1          | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| mouse        | 2          | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
Explanation: 
keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we do not include it in the result table.
