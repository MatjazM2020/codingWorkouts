Table: cities

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    | 
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(state, city) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.
Write a solution to find all the cities in each state and combine them into a single comma-separated string.

Return the result table ordered by state and city in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input:

cities table:

+-------------+---------------+
| state       | city          |
+-------------+---------------+

Output:

+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| state       | cities                                |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+

| New York    | Buffalo, New York City, Rochester     |
| Texas       | Austin, Dallas, Houston               |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+

New York: All cities ("Buffalo", "New York City", "Rochester") are listed in a comma-separated string.
Texas: All cities ("Austin", "Dallas", "Houston") are listed in a comma-separated string.
